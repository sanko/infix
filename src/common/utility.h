/**
 * @file utility.h
 * @brief A header for conditionally compiled debugging utilities.
 * @ingroup internal_utils
 *
 * @internal
 * This header is the central point for the library's internal debugging infrastructure.
 * Its primary feature is that it behaves differently based on the `INFIX_DEBUG_ENABLED`
 * preprocessor macro. This allows debugging code to be seamlessly integrated
 * during development without affecting the performance or size of the final
 * production binary.
 *
 * - **When `INFIX_DEBUG_ENABLED` is defined and non-zero (Debug Mode):**
 *   - It declares the `infix_dump_hex` function for detailed memory inspection.
 *   - It defines the `INFIX_DEBUG_PRINTF` macro, which integrates with the `double_tap`
 *     test harness's logging system (`note()`) if available, or falls back to a
 *     standard `printf`. This allows debug messages from the core library to appear
 *     cleanly within the test output.
 *
 * - **When `INFIX_DEBUG_ENABLED` is not defined or is zero (Release Mode):**
 *   - All debugging macros are defined as no-ops (`((void)0)`).
 *   - The `infix_dump_hex` function is defined as an empty `static inline` function.
 *   - This design ensures that all debugging code and calls are completely compiled
 *     out by the optimizer, resulting in zero overhead in release builds.
