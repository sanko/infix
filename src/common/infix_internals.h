 * @ingroup internal_common
 *
 * @details This is the primary internal header for the `infix` library. It defines the
 * complete layout of all opaque public structs (like `infix_forward_t`) and
 * declares internal-only functions (`_infix_*`) that are shared between modules.
 *
 * Its most important role is to define the core ABI abstraction layer through v-tables
 * (`infix_forward_abi_spec`, `infix_reverse_abi_spec`). These structures form the
 * contract between the platform-agnostic JIT engine (`trampoline.c`) and the
 * platform-specific ABI implementations (`arch/...`), making them key to the
 * library's portability and architectural design.
 *
 * This header also brings together all other internal type definitions, creating a
 * single source of truth for the library's internal data model.

 * @struct infix_executable_t
 * @brief Internal representation of an executable memory block for JIT code.
 *
 * @details This struct encapsulates the platform-specific details of allocating and
 * managing executable memory in a way that is compliant with modern OS security
 * features like W^X (Write XOR Execute). It supports two primary strategies:
 *
 * 1.  **Single-Mapping W^X (Windows/macOS/Android):** A single memory region is
 *     allocated as Read-Write (`rw_ptr`). After the JIT compiler writes the
 *     machine code to this region, its permissions are changed to Read-Execute.
 *     In this model, `rx_ptr` and `rw_ptr` point to the same address.
 *
 * 2.  **Dual-Mapping W^X (Linux/BSD):** A single underlying shared memory object
 *     is mapped into the process's address space twice: once as Read-Write
 *     (`rw_ptr`) and once as Read-Execute (`rx_ptr`). The pointers have different
 *     virtual addresses but point to the same physical memory. This is required
 *     on systems with stricter W^X enforcement.
