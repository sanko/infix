 * @brief Platform, architecture, and ABI detection macros.
 * @ingroup internal_common
 *
 * @details This header is the first to be included by `infix_internals.h` and is
 * responsible for defining a consistent set of `INFIX_*` macros that describe the
 * build environment. It is the central point of configuration for the entire library,
 * adapting the build to different operating systems, compilers, and CPU architectures.
 *
 * Its most critical function is to select the correct **Application Binary Interface (ABI)**
 * implementation to use for JIT code generation. This is achieved through a cascade
 * of preprocessor checks that can be overridden by the user for cross-compilation.
 * By the end of this file, exactly one `INFIX_ABI_*` macro must be defined, which
 * determines which `abi_*.c` file is included in the unity build.

 * are made available by system headers in a portable way across different C
 * library implementations (glibc, musl, BSD libc, etc.). Failing to define these
 * can lead to compilation failures due to implicitly declared functions on

 *     flag like `-DINFIX_FORCE_ABI_SYSV_X64`) to override automatic detection.
 *     This is essential for cross-compilation, where the host compiler's macros
 *     would not reflect the target environment.
 *
 * 2.  **Automatic Detection:** If no ABI is forced, it uses the `INFIX_ARCH_*` and
 *     `INFIX_OS_*` macros to deduce the correct ABI for the current build target.

 * @details When a trampoline handle is created, it deep-copies all type information
 * from a source (like the parser's temporary arena) into its own private arena.
 * The size of the source arena is used as a hint for the new arena's size, but the
 * copy process itself requires a small amount of extra memory for its own bookkeeping
 * (e.g., the memoization list in `_copy_type_graph_to_arena_recursive`). This
 * headroom provides that extra space to prevent allocation failures during the copy.
