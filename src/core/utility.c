 * is defined and set to a non-zero value.
 *
 * In release builds, this entire translation unit is effectively empty, ensuring
 * that debugging code has no impact on the final binary's size or performance.
 * The corresponding function declarations in `utility.h` become empty inline
 * stubs, which are optimized away by the compiler.

 * The output is formatted similarly to common hex dump utilities, with a 16-byte
 * width, address offsets, hexadecimal bytes, and an ASCII representation.

 *
 * @param data A pointer to the memory to dump.
 * @param size The number of bytes to dump.
