 * This header defines enums for the general-purpose (GPR) and SSE (XMM)
 * registers available on the x86-64 architecture. These enums are used by both
 * the Windows x64 and System V x64 ABI implementations to provide a clear,
 * type-safe way to refer to specific registers when emitting machine code.
 *
 * While the *usage* of these registers for argument passing differs significantly
 * between the two ABIs, the registers themselves and their numerical encoding are
 * universal. This header provides that common definition.

 * register describe its primary role and whether it is caller-saved (volatile)
