# Contributor Code of Conduct

No piece of code is as important as our collective peace of mind.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering a professional and productive open source community, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a respectful experience for everyone, regardless of background or experience level. Our primary focus is on building excellent software through technical collaboration.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive and productive environment include:
*   **Focusing on Technical Substance**: Keeping conversations centered on the technical merits of the topic at hand.
*   **Being Open to Constructive Criticism**: FFI and ABI details are complex. We value technical debate and the ability to accept and provide constructive feedback gracefully.
*   **Showing Respect for Differing Viewpoints**: Acknowledging that there can be multiple valid approaches to solving a technical problem.
*   **Clearly Articulating Ideas**: Providing context, code examples, and clear reasoning for proposals, bug reports, and pull requests. We welcome contributions of all sizes, but those that are well-researched and clearly communicated are the most likely to be addressed and integrated successfully.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
*   The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
*   Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks (ad hominem).
*   Public or private harassment.
*   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission.
*   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered unprofessional in a technical setting.

Contributors are expected to self-correct their behavior when asked to do so.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including the GitHub issue tracker, pull requests, and any other official communication channels. It also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainer(s) directly. Please provide as much detail as possible in your report.

**Contact**: sanko@cpan.org

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is inspired by common open-source codes of conduct, including the Contributor Covenant and the Go Code of Conduct.
