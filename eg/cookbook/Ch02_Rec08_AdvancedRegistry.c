 * @brief Cookbook Chapter 2, Recipe 8: Advanced Named Types (Recursive & Forward-Declared)
 *
 * This example demonstrates the full power of the `infix` Type Registry to model
 * complex, real-world C data structures. It shows how to define:
 * 1. A recursive type (a linked list `@Node`).
 * 2. Mutually-recursive types (`@Employee` and `@Manager`) using forward declarations.

// C equivalent of the mutually-recursive types we will define:

    Employee * reports[10];  // A manager has direct reports
} Manager;

struct Employee {
    const char * name;
    Manager * manager;  // An employee has a manager
