 * This header is not part of the main `infix` library. It serves as a centralized
 * place to define the C `struct` and `union` types that are used as targets for
 * FFI calls in multiple test files.
 *
 * By defining them here, we ensure that the layout (`sizeof`, `_Alignof`, `offsetof`)
 * is consistent and matches what the C compiler produces, which is essential for
 * validating the correctness of the `infix` type system and ABI classifiers.
