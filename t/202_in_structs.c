/**
 * @file 202_in_structs.c
 * @brief Unit test for passing structs that contain pointer members.
 * @ingroup test_suite
 *
 * @details This test case is an important follow-up to `201_basic.c`. It verifies
 * that `infix` can correctly handle structs that are passed by value, but which
 * themselves contain pointer members.
 *
 * The ABI classifier must correctly identify the struct as an aggregate to be passed
 * according to the platform's rules (e.g., in registers or on the stack). The JIT
 * code must then correctly copy the entire struct, including the pointer values
 * within it.
 *
 * The test defines a `PointerStruct` containing an `int*` and a `const char*`.
 * It calls a C function that takes this struct by value, dereferences the pointers
 * inside it, and verifies their contents. This confirms that the pointer values
 * were correctly preserved through the FFI call.
